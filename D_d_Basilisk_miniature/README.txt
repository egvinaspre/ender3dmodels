# Summary

Sculpted this basilisk for my own campaign. Model is a large scale creature on a 5 cm base.
Let me know if you had success printing it and have fun.
I have added more detail to the model, now scales are visible and will paint well. I also added more spikes around legs and spine. I'm happy with this. Some size tweaks might be needed before printing, just to be sure the scaling is correct.
I hope you'll have fun with it. 

Tips are appreciated and welcomed.
